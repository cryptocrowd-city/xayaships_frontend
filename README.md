Xayaships
 is a blockchain version of the classic naval warfare Battleship game. 
Battleship has been around since at least the 1930s, but it was in 1967 
that Milton Bradley created the plastic board and peg version that most 
people are familiar with. Its rules are relatively simple but gameplay 
is relatively quick and perfect to demonstrate the cutting edge Game 
Channels technology that Xaya allows.
