Xayaships
 is a blockchain version of the classic naval warfare Battleship game. 
Battleship has been around since at least the 1930s, but it was in 1967 
that Milton Bradley created the plastic board and peg version that most 
people are familiar with. Its rules are relatively simple but gameplay 
is relatively quick and perfect to demonstrate the cutting edge Game 
Channels technology that Xaya allows.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xayaships demonstrates Game Channels 
for developers and shows how they can create near real time games that 
run entirely on the blockchain in a trustless and decentralised way.<br> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With respect to the Xaya platform, Game Channels can be thought of as individual payment channels that games run in.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They work by submitting a special 
transaction on the Xaya blockchain that creates a channel which other 
players can join. For Xayaships, when a channel is opened directly 
between 2 participants, real time gameplay can begin. In game channels 
the number of transactions can be unlimited, for free, and the speed is 
only limited by the network latency between the 2 players. Once a game 
is complete the winner can prove he won by posting the state to the 
blockchain. The other player can try to dispute it, but in the end the 
real winner will win as he has all the signed moves of the other player 
which prove he lost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In all, a complex and real-time game 
can be played in a trustless, decentralised, provably fair way with 
little transaction fees and massively reducing blockchain bloat.</span></p>
